## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- docs: Enhanced project documentation with comprehensive guides
  - Created detailed testing strategy documentation covering unit, integration, property-based, performance, E2E, and failure recovery testing approaches
  - Enhanced Sphinx documentation structure with improved API references and testing strategy integration
  - Added comprehensive protocol module documentation with usage examples and best practices
  - Created protocol strategy guides for Scroll, zkSync, and multi-protocol farming with detailed optimization strategies
  - Added extensive configuration examples covering development, production, and advanced deployment scenarios
  - Wrote comprehensive troubleshooting guide with solutions for common issues, debugging scripts, and recovery procedures
  - Generated API documentation script and enhanced Sphinx RST files for better code documentation

### Added
- feat(code): Implemented predictive analytics module for airdrop timing predictions with foundational machine learning capabilities, including AirdropPredictor class with heuristic model, data source stubs for market data/on-chain activity/social sentiment, Pydantic models for structured prediction outputs with confidence scoring, comprehensive testing suite, and enhanced analytics documentation
- feat(test): Improved test coverage for EigenLayer protocol module to 96% with 15+ comprehensive test cases covering restake_lst() function, strategy details, deposit caps, ABI loading, and various edge cases including error handling and input validation
- feat(test): Created comprehensive integration tests for Scroll and zkSync protocols
  - Added test_scroll_integration.py with tests for scheduler execution, capital allocation, monitoring metrics, risk validation, and end-to-end workflows
  - Added test_zksync_integration.py with tests for bridge/swap/lending operations through scheduler, cross-protocol workflows, and performance-based reallocation
  - Fixed method signatures to match actual implementation (optimize_portfolio, allocate_risk_adjusted_capital)
  - Included proper mock setups for Web3 instances and protocol functions
- feat(test): Added integration tests for scheduler, capital allocation, and monitoring systems
  - Created test_scheduler_protocols.py with tests for multi-protocol task execution, dependency resolution, retry logic, gas limits, and load balancing
  - Created test_capital_allocation_integration.py with tests for portfolio optimization, risk-adjusted allocation, rebalancing triggers, multi-wallet distribution, and emergency withdrawals
  - Created test_monitoring_integration.py with tests for metrics collection, aggregation, alerting, health checks, dashboard data generation, and cross-protocol performance comparison
  - All integration tests use proper mocking to avoid external dependencies while testing component interactions
- feat(test): Added advanced testing capabilities for robustness and reliability
  - Created test_property_based.py using Hypothesis framework for property-based testing of capital allocation, monitoring metrics, portfolio management, and scheduler operations
  - Created test_performance_benchmarks.py with comprehensive performance tests for critical operations including portfolio optimization (<100ms), metrics collection (>10k tx/s), and concurrent operations
  - Created test_end_to_end.py with real-world scenarios including daily operation cycles, multi-day portfolio evolution, incident response workflows, and performance optimization
  - Created test_failure_recovery.py testing recovery from network failures, transaction failures, state corruption, monitoring failures, and cascading failure prevention with circuit breakers

### Fixed
- fix(zksync): Fixed type annotations and mypy --strict compliance for zkSync protocol module
  - Added proper type hints for all function parameters and return types
  - Fixed Web3 address type conversions using Web3.to_checksum_address()
  - Resolved TxParams type casting issues for contract function calls
  - Fixed Optional[bool] type handling for collateral_status parameter
  - Updated imports to use correct type definitions from web3 and eth_typing packages
- fix(zksync): Fixed zkSync test failures due to transaction receipt status handling
  - Updated receipt status checks to use dict.get() method for compatibility
  - Fixed mock objects in tests to return proper dict structures instead of Mock objects
  - Ensured gas estimation mocks return numeric values for arithmetic operations

### Changed
- chore(quality): Enhanced code quality standards enforcement
  - All protocol modules now pass mypy --strict type checking
  - All protocol modules pass ruff linting with zero violations
  - Improved test coverage from 15% to 80% (target was 85%)
  - Fixed all import errors in test files
  - Added missing dependencies (hypothesis, type stubs for psutil and PyYAML)
  - Fixed 21 mypy type errors across multiple modules
  - Version bumped from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

### Known Issues
- 66 integration/end-to-end tests still failing (primarily due to mock setup issues)
- Test coverage at 80% instead of target 85%
- Some protocol implementations need additional unit test coverage
