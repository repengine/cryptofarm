# Risk Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Risk Management System is a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating risks associated with automated airdrop farming activities. This system serves as the foundational safety layer for the entire airdrops automation project, ensuring that all operations remain within acceptable risk parameters.

## Purpose

The Risk Management System provides:

- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Continuous monitoring of portfolio positions, gas costs, and market conditions
- **Configurable Risk Controls**: Flexible limits and thresholds that can be adjusted based on risk tolerance
- **Circuit Breaker Mechanisms**: Automatic halt capabilities when critical risk thresholds are exceeded
- **Multi-layered Safety**: Protection across protocol exposure, transaction size, and asset concentration dimensions

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### RiskManager Class
The main class that orchestrates all risk management activities:

- **Position Monitoring**: Tracks wallet balances and protocol exposures across multiple networks
- **Gas Cost Monitoring**: Real-time gas price tracking with configurable thresholds
- **Market Volatility Assessment**: Volatility state classification for risk-adjusted operations
- **Circuit Breaker Controls**: Emergency stop mechanisms for critical risk scenarios

#### Risk Metrics and Limits
- **RiskMetrics**: Data structure containing current risk assessment results
- **RiskLimits**: Configurable parameters defining acceptable risk boundaries
- **RiskLevel**: Enumeration for risk state classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- **VolatilityState**: Market volatility classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME)

### Key Features

#### Real-time Assessment & Monitoring
- **Data Sources**: On-chain wallet balances, transaction statuses, gas prices via Web3 providers
- **Monitored Metrics**: Portfolio value/P&L, protocol exposures, gas price feeds, system anomalies
- **Network Support**: Ethereum mainnet, Scroll L2, and extensible to other networks

#### Position & Exposure Limits
- **Protocol Limit**: Maximum percentage of total capital per protocol (default: 20%)
- **Transaction Limit**: Maximum percentage of total capital per transaction (default: 5%)
- **Asset Concentration Limit**: Maximum exposure to single crypto-asset (default: 30%)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Maximum acceptable daily portfolio loss (default: 10%)

#### Gas Price Management
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Current and historical gas price tracking
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Acceptable gas price limits per transaction type (default: 100 Gwei)
- **Transaction Optimization**: Delay/reschedule non-critical transactions during high gas periods

#### Circuit Breakers & Emergency Stops
**Triggers**:
- Predefined portfolio loss threshold exceeded
- Sustained high gas prices rendering operations unprofitable
- Critical security vulnerabilities detected in engaged protocols
- Anomalous system behavior or repeated critical errors
- Manual administrator trigger

**Actions**:
- Immediate halt of all new transaction deployments
- Safe completion of critical in-flight transactions (where possible)
- Administrator notifications with detailed alert information

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
airdrops/src/airdrops/risk_management/
├── __init__.py          # Module exports
└── core.py              # Main RiskManager implementation
```

### Dependencies
- **web3**: Ethereum blockchain interaction
- **requests**: HTTP API calls for market data
- **decimal**: Precise financial calculations
- **logging**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Configuration
Risk parameters can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Risk Limits
RISK_MAX_PROTOCOL_EXPOSURE_PCT=20.0
RISK_MAX_TRANSACTION_SIZE_PCT=5.0
RISK_MAX_ASSET_CONCENTRATION_PCT=30.0
RISK_MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT=10.0
RISK_MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=100.0

# Volatility Thresholds
RISK_VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH=0.05
RISK_VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD_EXTREME=0.15

# Network RPC URLs
ETH_RPC_URL=https://your-ethereum-rpc-url
SCROLL_L2_RPC_URL=https://your-scroll-rpc-url
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Manager Setup
```python
from airdrops.risk_management import RiskManager

# Initialize with default configuration
risk_manager = RiskManager()

# Monitor positions across wallets
wallet_addresses = ["0x123...", "0x456..."]
exposures = risk_manager.monitor_positions(wallet_addresses)

# Check current gas costs
gas_price = risk_manager.monitor_gas_costs("ethereum")

# Assess market volatility
volatility = risk_manager.monitor_market_volatility(["ETH", "BTC"])
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
config = {
    "max_protocol_exposure_pct": "15.0",
    "max_gas_price_gwei": "80.0"
}

risk_manager = RiskManager(config=config)
```

## Integration Points

The Risk Management System is designed to integrate with:

1. **Capital Allocation Engine**: Provides risk constraints and operational controls
2. **Central Scheduler**: Supplies market conditions and safety checks for task execution
3. **Protocol Modules**: Receives risk assessments for transaction decisions
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Outputs risk metrics and alerts for administrator oversight

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Volatility Models**: Integration with sophisticated volatility indices
- **Machine Learning Risk Scoring**: Predictive risk assessment using historical data
- **Multi-asset Correlation Analysis**: Cross-asset risk assessment and portfolio optimization
- **Real-time Price Oracles**: Integration with Chainlink and other price feed providers
- **Enhanced Circuit Breakers**: More granular and protocol-specific emergency controls

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests with mock Web3 providers
- Edge case testing for error conditions
- Performance testing for real-time monitoring capabilities

## Security Considerations

- **No Secret Logging**: Ensures private keys and sensitive data are never logged
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network failures and API errors
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive API calls that could trigger rate limits
