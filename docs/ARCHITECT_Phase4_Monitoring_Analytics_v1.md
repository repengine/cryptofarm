### PCRM Analysis
**Pros:**
*   Comprehensive Observability: Provides deep insights into system health, performance, and financial outcomes.
*   Data-Driven Decisions: Enables optimization of airdrop strategies based on historical performance and ROI.
*   Proactive Issue Detection: Real-time alerting helps in quickly addressing operational problems.
*   Scalable Architecture: Prometheus and PostgreSQL are capable of handling growing data volumes.
*   Industry Standards: Utilizes well-known and robust open-source technologies.

**Cons:**
*   Increased Complexity: Adds new components (Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL, ETL) to the system.
*   Resource Overhead: Monitoring and database systems will consume additional server resources.
*   Initial Setup Effort: Setting up and configuring the new stack requires significant upfront work.
*   Learning Curve: Team may need to learn new tools and concepts (PromQL, Grafana dashboarding, ETL processes).

**Risks:**
*   Metric Overload/Noise: Defining too many or irrelevant metrics can make dashboards and alerts less effective.
    *   Mitigation: Start with a core set of essential metrics (TB-2) and iterate. Regularly review metric utility.
*   Data Inconsistency: Discrepancies between Prometheus data and PostgreSQL data due to ETL issues.
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust validation and reconciliation checks in the ETL pipeline (TB-7). Monitor ETL job success.
*   Alert Fatigue: Poorly configured alerts leading to excessive notifications.
    *   Mitigation: Carefully define alert thresholds and conditions (TB-5). Implement alert grouping and silencing strategies.
*   Scalability Bottlenecks: ETL process or PostgreSQL queries might become slow with large data volumes.
    *   Mitigation: Design efficient ETL processes and database queries (TB-7, TB-8). Monitor performance and optimize as needed. Consider database indexing.
*   Security of New Components: Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL need to be secured.
    *   Mitigation: Follow security best practices for deploying these components (network ACLs, strong credentials, regular updates).
