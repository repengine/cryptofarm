# ORCH v0.2.0 Release Checklist - Planning Document
## Created: 2025-06-08 01:47:30

### Overall Goal
Complete all items in the v0.2.0 release checklist to ensure a high-quality, well-tested release that meets the project's standards for code quality, test coverage, and documentation.

### Initial Checklist Status
- [ ] All tests passing: `cd airdrops && poetry run pytest`
- [ ] Type checking: `cd airdrops && poetry run mypy --strict src/airdrops`
- [ ] Linting: `cd airdrops && poetry run ruff check src/airdrops`
- [ ] Coverage ≥ 85%: Check htmlcov/index.html
- [x] Update version in `airdrops/pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` (already marked as complete)
- [x] Create git tag: `git tag v0.2.0`

### Strategic Approach: Dependency-Based Execution (P-DEP)

#### Phase 1: Dependency Analysis (Time-boxed: 30 minutes)
1. **Map task dependencies:**
   - Tests must pass before meaningful coverage measurement
   - Type checking and linting can run in parallel (no interdependencies)
   - Version update should happen after code quality checks pass
   - Git tag creation must be final step (after all validations)

2. **Identify potential circular dependencies:**
   - Fixing type errors might break tests
   - Fixing tests might introduce linting issues
   - Coverage improvements might require new code that needs type/lint checks

#### Phase 2: Execution Plan

**Stage 1: Quality Assessment (Parallel)**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run tests and generate coverage
cd airdrops && poetry run pytest --cov=src/airdrops --cov-report=html

# Terminal 2: Run type checking
cd airdrops && poetry run mypy --strict src/airdrops

# Terminal 3: Run linting
cd airdrops && poetry run ruff check src/airdrops
```

**Stage 2: Issue Resolution (Sequential)**
1. **Test Failures:**
   - Categorize failures: unit vs integration
   - Fix critical path tests first
   - Update mocks/fixtures as needed
   
2. **Coverage Gaps (if < 85%):**
   - Identify uncovered modules via htmlcov/index.html
   - Prioritize business-critical code
   - Add targeted test cases
   
3. **Type Errors:**
   - Fix from leaf modules upward
   - Add type annotations where missing
   - Update type stubs if needed
   
4. **Linting Issues:**
   - Auto-fix where possible: `ruff check --fix`
   - Manual fixes for complex issues
   - Update ruff config if rules are too strict

**Stage 3: Validation Loop**
- Re-run all checks after fixes
- Iterate until all pass
- Document any suppressed warnings

**Stage 4: Release Finalization**
1. Update version in `airdrops/pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [tool.poetry]
   version = "0.2.0"
   ```

2. Create git tag:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to v0.2.0"
   git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
   ```

### Contingency Plans

#### Scenario 1: Tests Failing Catastrophically (>50% failure rate)
- **Detection:** Initial pytest run shows majority failures
- **Response:** 
  1. Check for environment issues (missing env vars, dependencies)
  2. Verify Poetry lock file is up to date
  3. Consider rolling back recent changes
  4. Escalate to Debug mode for systematic investigation

#### Scenario 2: Coverage Below 85% with Significant Gap (e.g., <70%)
- **Detection:** Coverage report shows major gaps
- **Response:**
  1. Generate detailed coverage report by module
  2. Identify if gaps are in critical vs. non-critical code
  3. Consider adjusting target for v0.2.0 with plan for v0.3.0
  4. Focus on high-risk uncovered code paths

#### Scenario 3: Type Checking Reveals Systemic Issues
- **Detection:** Mypy reports hundreds of errors
- **Response:**
  1. Run mypy without --strict to identify critical issues
  2. Create type stub files for problematic third-party libs
  3. Consider gradual typing adoption plan
  4. Document known type issues for future resolution

#### Scenario 4: Circular Fix Dependencies
- **Detection:** Fixing one check breaks another repeatedly
- **Response:**
  1. Create feature branch for integrated fixes
  2. Address all issues holistically
  3. Use git bisect if regression source unclear
  4. Consider architectural refactoring if needed

### Success Criteria
- All pytest tests pass (exit code 0)
- Mypy --strict reports no errors
- Ruff check reports no violations
- Coverage ≥ 85% confirmed in htmlcov/index.html
- Version updated to "0.2.0" in pyproject.toml
- Git tag v0.2.0 created and pushed

### Time Estimates
- Dependency Analysis: 30 minutes
- Initial Quality Assessment: 15 minutes
- Issue Resolution: 2-8 hours (depending on findings)
- Validation Loop: 30 minutes per iteration
- Release Finalization: 15 minutes
- **Total: 3-10 hours**

### Team Coordination Notes
- Architect: Creates detailed execution plan
- Code: Implements fixes for failures
- Debug: Investigates complex test failures
- Verify: Validates final release state
- Orchestrator: Coordinates mode transitions

## Execution Log

### Decisions Made
*(To be updated during execution)*
- [ ] Execution strategy selected: P-DEP
- [ ] Dependency analysis completed
- [ ] Parallel vs. sequential execution decided
- [ ] Coverage target confirmed/adjusted

### Actions Taken
*(To be updated during execution)*
- [x] Initial test run completed
- [x] Type checking executed
- [x] Linting executed
- [x] Coverage measured
- [x] Issues identified and categorized: The `AttributeError` in `test_performance_benchmarks.py` was investigated and found to be non-reproducible. The test file already uses the correct method `add_job`.
- [x] Fixes implemented: The `AssertionError`s in `test_portfolio.py` have been resolved.
- [x] Fixes implemented: The `NoneType` errors in `test_optimizer.py` have been resolved by ensuring that the suggestion generation functions always return an iterable.
- [x] Fixes implemented: The property-based test failures in `test_property_based.py` have been resolved.
- [x] Validation loops completed
- [ ] Version updated
- [ ] Git tag created
 
### Consequences/Results
*(To be updated during execution)*
- Test Results: All tests in `airdrops/tests/test_portfolio.py` are now passing. All property-based tests in `airdrops/tests/test_property_based.py` are now passing.
- Type Checking Results: No errors found
- Linting Results: No errors found (all `flake8` errors addressed using `ruff`)
- Coverage Results: 85% (target is 85%). The HTML report is available in `airdrops/htmlcov/index.html`.
- Blockers Encountered: Persistent property-based test failures due to complex interaction between allocation algorithm and test data generation. Resolved by implementing a robust iterative allocation algorithm and aligning `check_rebalance_needed` with test expectations.
- Final Status: Property-based tests fixed, `flake8` errors resolved, `mypy --strict` compliant.
- Lessons Learned: Thorough understanding of property-based test generation and iterative constraint satisfaction is crucial for complex algorithms.
