# Pulse Inventory - Airdrop Automation Project

This document provides an inventory of all modules and key components within the airdrop automation project.

## Core Modules
*   `airdrops.core`: Shared utilities and base classes. (Details TBD)
*   `airdrops.scheduler`: Central Scheduler providing APScheduler-based task orchestration with DAG dependency management, market condition awareness, and robust error handling with retry logic. Integrates with Risk Management System and Capital Allocation Engine for intelligent scheduling decisions. (See `airdrops/docs/scheduler.md`)
*   `airdrops.risk_management`: Risk Management System providing real-time risk assessment, monitoring, and control for automated airdrop farming activities. Includes position monitoring, gas cost tracking, and market volatility assessment. (See `airdrops/docs/risk_management.md`)
*   `airdrops.capital_allocation`: Capital Allocation Engine providing portfolio optimization, risk-adjusted capital allocation, and rebalancing for automated airdrop farming. Integrates with the Risk Management System to ensure safe and efficient capital deployment. (See `airdrops/docs/capital_allocation.md`)
*   `airdrops.monitoring`: Monitoring Infrastructure providing comprehensive metrics collection, aggregation, real-time alerting, operational health checks, and performance monitoring dashboards for system observability. Collects metrics from Phase 3 components (RiskManager, CapitalAllocator, CentralScheduler) and system-level metrics, exposing them in Prometheus format. Includes real-time alerting system with configurable rules and multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, webhooks). Features operational health checks with HTTP endpoints for component and system health verification. Provides comprehensive Grafana dashboard configurations for system overview, risk management, capital allocation, scheduler performance, and alerting system monitoring. All modules pass `mypy --strict` type checking and `ruff` linting with zero violations. (See `airdrops/docs/monitoring.md`)
*   `airdrops.analytics`: Analytics Platform providing comprehensive airdrop tracking, reporting, ROI analysis, portfolio performance analytics, and predictive analytics capabilities. Features AirdropTracker for recording and retrieving airdrop events with SQLAlchemy-based database storage, AirdropReporter for generating detailed analytics reports with protocol summaries, top protocols analysis, and monthly breakdowns, ROIOptimizer for calculating Return on Investment metrics and generating optimization suggestions, PortfolioPerformanceAnalyzer for comprehensive portfolio performance analytics including overall portfolio value tracking, profit/loss analysis, diversification metrics using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Value at Risk estimation, benchmark comparison with alpha calculation against ETH/BTC/market indices, and portfolio value evolution tracking over custom time periods, and AirdropPredictor for foundational predictive analytics on airdrop timing. Supports multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, console), flexible cost models (simple gas, manual input, estimated), three optimization strategies (ROI maximization, risk-adjusted, diversified), and heuristic-based timing predictions with confidence scoring. Includes data source stubs for market data, on-chain activity, and social sentiment analysis. Features robust data validation with Pydantic models and integrates with monitoring infrastructure for comprehensive system observability. (See `airdrops/docs/analytics.md`)

## Documentation Infrastructure
*   **Sphinx API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation system using Sphinx with autodoc, napoleon, and ReadTheDocs theme. Located in `airdrops/docs/sphinx/` with complete coverage of all modules including protocols, scheduler, risk management, capital allocation, monitoring, analytics, and shared utilities. Features automatic documentation generation from Python docstrings with Google-style formatting, cross-references, and professional HTML output. Configured with intersphinx for linking to external documentation (Python, web3, pandas, numpy) and includes proper type hint support via sphinx-autodoc-typehints extension.
*   **User Installation and Setup Guides**: Comprehensive user documentation including Installation Guide (`airdrops/docs/sphinx/installation_guide.rst`) covering prerequisites, dependency installation with Poetry, environment configuration, and initial setup verification; Setup Guide (`airdrops/docs/sphinx/setup_guide.rst`) covering post-installation configuration of all core modules (Risk Manager, Capital Allocator, Central Scheduler, Monitoring, Analytics), wallet setup, protocol-specific configuration, and production deployment considerations; and environment template (`.env.example`) providing comprehensive configuration template with all required environment variables for blockchain RPC URLs, wallet configuration, API keys, risk management settings, capital allocation parameters, scheduler configuration, monitoring and alerting, analytics settings, and protocol-specific configurations.

## Protocol Modules
*   `airdrops.protocols.hyperliquid`: Module for interacting with the Hyperliquid protocol. Supports `stake_rotate`, `vault_cycle`, `spot_swap`, `evm_roundtrip`, `perform_random_onchain` with comprehensive test coverage (81% module coverage, 48 total tests covering all major functions, helper functions, and error scenarios). Features extensive mock integration for Hyperliquid SDK agents and Web3 instances, ensuring robust testing of all protocol interactions. (See `airdrops/docs/protocols/hyperliquid.md`)
*   `airdrops.protocols.layerzero`: Module for LayerZero/Stargate cross-chain bridging. Supports `bridge`, `perform_random_bridge`. (See `airdrops/docs/protocols/layerzero.md`)
*   `airdrops.protocols.zksync`: Module for zkSync Era Layer 2 interactions. Supports `bridge_eth` for ETH bridging between L1 and L2, `swap_tokens` for DEX token swapping via SyncSwap, `lend_borrow` for lending protocol interactions via EraLend, and `perform_random_activity` for orchestrated random activity execution. (See `airdrops/docs/protocols/zksync.md`)
*   `airdrops.protocols.scroll`: Module for Scroll L2 interactions. Supports `bridge_assets` for ETH and ERC20 bridging between L1 and L2, `swap_tokens` for DEX token swapping via SyncSwap, `provide_liquidity_scroll` for adding/removing liquidity on SyncSwap, `lend_borrow_layerbank_scroll` for lending/borrowing on LayerBank V2 protocol, and `perform_random_activity_scroll` for orchestrated random activity execution across all Scroll protocols. (See `airdrops/docs/protocols/scroll.md`)
*   `airdrops.protocols.eigenlayer`: Module for EigenLayer restaking protocol interactions. Supports `restake_lst` for LST restaking (stETH, rETH), `restake_eth` for native ETH restaking via EigenPod, `withdraw` for multi-step withdrawal process with escrow period, `query_status` for comprehensive status queries, and `perform_random_activity` for automated restaking activity generation. (See `airdrops/docs/protocols/eigenlayer.md`)
